The software project's continuous integration and deployment are coordinated by this Jenkins pipeline script. The process is divided into multiple stages: "Build" involves using Maven to compile the project; "Unit and Integration Tests" involves running tests and notifying email recipients of success or failure; "Code Analysis" evaluates the quality of the code using SonarQube; "Security Scan" verifies dependencies using OWASP; "Deploy to Staging" involves using AWS CLI to deploy to a staging environment; "Integration Tests on Staging" involves executing more tests in the staging environment; and "Deploy to Production" involves deploying to the production server. Finally, post-actions are included to inform on pipeline success or failure. Code quality, security, and dependable deployment are ensured by each stage of the software development lifecycle, which stands for a certain duty.
